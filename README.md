# BacVM

BacVM, short for Baccalaureate VM, is a toy virtual machine that executes human friendly "BVM" bytecode.
The aim of the virtual machine is to provide a common ground between tokenizing/basic parsing and actual execution.
Moreover, I intend to use it to server as a base virtual machine such that I can experiment with different scripting languages which all have the same common backend.
